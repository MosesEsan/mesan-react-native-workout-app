### Demo
![Demo](https://github.com/MosesEsan/mesan-react-native-workout-app/blob/master/demo.gif "demo")

For this project, I will be creating a gym workout app using React Native, the app will allow users to browse for exercises based on a specific body part (Chest, Back, Abs Legs), users can add exercises to their “Wish List”, the selected exercises can then be used to create a workout plan.

The first part of this project will focus on building the app using sample data sourced from bodybuilding.com, the second part will focus on building a Django API to be used by the app, after this we will then updated the app to use the API.
